The process of collecting information includes: the host provides information, the platform payment modules record prices, and the tenant provide rental evaluation feedback.

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

The collected data can basically show the housing situation and guests situation, but because the data collected by the platform has no reviewer, the authenticity and accuracy of these data cannot be verified. All data is provided by the hosts and the guests through the Internet, and these data may be purposeful or emotional. If the number of housing guests is not enough, mutual corroboration cannot be carried out through a large amount of data. The lower the credibility of the housing data, and the lack of data integrity.

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

Extracting the basic information of houses can support analysis of the number of guests in the area, distribution of housing, circulation of migrants, and rent market level.

Extracting data such as guests' rental price, rental duration, itinerary, and traffic information can support the analysis of regional tourism and business conditions. Extracting basic information of hosts and guests can support customer source analysis, such as tenant nationality, work, family members, wealth status, social networking site dynamic sharing and other information.

Unknown equipment and facilities in the house cannot support guests demand analysis, and the inability to accurately extract information about the religious and cultural differences between the hosts and the guests may cause discomfort after moving in.

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

Hay (2010) states that it is impossible to have a clear set of rules for conducting ethical research when it comes to doing research involving people. People's expectations of a researcher vary across cultures, which means that there is no "correct" approach to fit all contexts.[1]
With the knowledge of the user, the data analysis used to get the general situation is ethical, and the mining of personal information may be unethical. For example, the information used to analyze housing situation, community management situation, real estate industry ecological situation, rent situation, population movement situation, tourism industry, business situation, etc. is beneficial to the development of the homestay rental industry and social economy. However, personal financial status, work, personal itinerary, rent affordability, family members and other information mined through the personal information of hosts and guests will cause damage to personal privacy. If the user information obtained by the website is associated with the content shared by the guests on Facebook, then there is a great possibility to fully grasp the guests' information, social relations and behavior, so that the guests has no privacy at all.
